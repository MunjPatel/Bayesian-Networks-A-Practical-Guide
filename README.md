# Bayesian Networks: A Practical Guide

This repository contains the code accompanying the Medium article: [Bayesian Networks: A Practical Guide](https://medium.com/@patelmunj2011/bayesian-networks-a-practical-guide-4edf97e4e6d4).

## Overview

The code demonstrates the application of Bayesian inference and probabilistic graphical modeling techniques to real-world problems in prediction and decision-making. By leveraging Bayesian Networks to model relationships between variables, the code showcases how to simplify complex systems, quantify uncertainty, and gain actionable insights. These techniques are pivotal in areas like financial modeling, healthcare diagnostics, and weather forecasting, where understanding dependencies and making data-driven predictions are critical.
